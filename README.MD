## Bulletin Board

This is my sample freelance-type application. 
I am writing it to learn or practise new development technologies.

## Desctiption

This application is built using **Spring Boot** & **AngularJS** framework.
It is also based on **PostgreSQL database** using **Liquibase Version Control**.

## Project status

The application is **in development** right now. 
I will update it and implement new features into it in my free time. 

Below you can find out what **is already in use** and what I am going to add **soon**.

## Usage

As soon as this application will be well-built enough for user testing, 
I will add here a **link to a site** or a **localhost installation guide**.

## What I am currently doing

Right now I am studying basics of frontend development (html, css, javascript, typescript).
